# Netflix Userbase Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix userbase dataset to uncover insights about user demographics, subscription patterns, revenue metrics, and usage behaviors. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, and comprehensive visualizations to understand the Netflix user ecosystem.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the **Netflix Userbase Dataset** available on Kaggle.
